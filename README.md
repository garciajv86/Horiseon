# Challenge-1

Followed the user story and acceptance criteria below to complete the challenge.

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Description

The website did not follow semantic HTML in the code, So semantic HTML was created in the HTML code and the CSS was corrected accordingly. Even though the sites HTML code was corrected, the site itself still holds it integrity and looks the same as before. On the site if you click any of the 3 words in the top right corner of the site it will take you down to the corresponding section. If you right click on the page to go view the source code, you will now find semantic HTML elements. Also the elements now follow a logical structure.
